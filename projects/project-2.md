This website was a simple website made for a small family run buisness on Maui. The purpose of this website was to allow possible customers to see the menu and to find the location of the restaurant. It also allows customers to find the contact information for the restaurant.

This website was made using WordPress. It uses a basic theme along with some free to use widgets in order to make the menu page. I organized the layout of the pages and set up the menu item.

summary: I worked to create test cases for a scheme to c++ converter.
---


For this project we were trying to create a scheme to c++ converter. In this project I was tasked with making test cases for the program. In order to do this I was tasked with learning to use google tests and learn how to work through terminal a bit. This project was also my first time working with GitHub.

During my time on this project there was a lot of miscommunication that we had to work through but in the end we did have a semi-working program. Through this project I learned about what a programming language is and the different things that make up a language such as a character and an alphabet.

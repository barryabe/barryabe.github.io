I can see the appeal of JavaScript as a programming language. There are some nice features that come with the language, such as not needing to specify the type of a variable. Many of the features are similiar to other programming languages, such as a for and while loop, which is nice. JavaScript seems like it would be useful as a programming language for a software engineer due to how variables work.

I think that being able to store things as just variable makes it a lot easier to receive an input. I do see a downside of the program having to figure out how to use what it has recieved. This means that a programmer has to be a lot more careful with what a vafiable can do or how it is read.

I find the WODs to be useful so far. I find them a good way to practice quickly figuring out a solution and converting this idea into code. I think that the style of work can be a little stressful but overall I feel like it will help me to learn.

Semantic UI seemed like a pain to learn. After working to learn how to use raw HTML it seems counter intuitive to use Semantic UI at first. Once I started to use Semantic UI it did start to make sense as to why we are using it. 
   
At first I saw next to no reason to use Semantic UI over raw HTML and CSS. It seemed like everything that I was using Semantic UI for could also be done with HTML. Once I started to use Semantic UI more I started to realize, yeah this is pretty useful. Having the option to simply type center into a class and have whatever I needed centered centered, started to make the programming process easier. At this time working with Semantic UI is significantly faster than adjusting with raw HTML.
   
The more time I invest in learning Semantic UI the more comfortable I start to feel programming webpages. There is still quite a lot that I am unsure of in Semantic UI such as making very small adjustments, though I'm sure that I can learn more as time goes on. Moving onto React before I have a full understanding of Semantic UI feels like a large step to me currently, but I am sure that I will have the chance to learn more of both as the assignments come.

  My belief is that coding standards are an important part of being an efficient programmer. Clear code is very helpful when learning how to codes. This is because as a beginner looking at a whole page of words with no orginzation can be difficult. But once we see the code organized and properly commented we can quickly learn what each part of the code does.
   
   I found that IntelliJ works fairly well as a IDE. I don't have too strong of an opinion of it at the moment. Seeing the errors pop up on the side is nice but it can be fustrating to make my code work around what ESLint wants. Overall its a good experience to become familiar with a different IDE.
   
   Code should have at least a little bit of structure behind it. I don't think that having a lot of spaghetti code is ever a good thing. But I do enjoy being able to have a certain amount of open ended ness when programming. Part of the reason that I enjoy programming is the ability top approach a problem in my own way.
